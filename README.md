# Project Title: WeaDa

Weada is a user-friendly weather application designed to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information for any location around the world. The app allows users to search for weather conditions by city name, using a real-time search function that displays relevant weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Weada also includes a feature to view the weather forecast for the next few days, ensuring users are always prepared for upcoming weather changes. The interface is intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy for users to navigate and find the information they need. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch reliable weather data and ensures user convenience with a seamless and responsive design.
